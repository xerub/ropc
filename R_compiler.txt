Part 2. The Lexer
=================

Will tokenize ONE line of text with maximum 64 tokens.
The lexer recognizes C preprocessor output directives:
    # NUMBER "filename"
    #line NUMBER "filename"

Each line must be exactly one rule in the grammar.
Comments begin with ';', so unlike C, you cannot have
multiple statements/expressions in the same line.

Also unlike C, statements need not be terminated
with ';' but is a good practice, because after
the semicolon you can write about anything.

Keywords:
    if		T_K_IF
    goto	T_K_GOTO
    const	T_K_CONST
    extern	T_K_EXTERN
    volatile	T_K_VOLATILE
Regular tokens:
    :		T_COLON
    ,		T_COMMA
    {		T_OPENCURLY
    }		T_CLOSECURLY
    [		T_OPENSQUARE
    ]		T_CLOSESQUARE
    (		T_OPENBRACE
    )		T_CLOSEBRACE
    =		T_ASSIGN
    !		T_LOGICNOT
    +		T_ADD
    -		T_SUB
    *		T_MUL
    &		T_AND
Strings:
    "a", 'b'	T_STRING
Numbers:
    0x1, 077, 5	T_INT
Identifiers:
    a3, bla	T_ID

Part 3. The Parser
==================

Will parse ONE line of text into "struct the_node".
    struct the_node::next	contains the next node in source
    struct the_node::edge[]	contains the following nodes in execution flow
    struct the_node::code	code to emit: a list of nodes representing statements
